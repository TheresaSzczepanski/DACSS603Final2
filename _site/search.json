    "text": "Key Variables\nTo explore the relationship between the distribution of a school’s students’ Performance Level and a school’s performance in content categories, we examine the percentage of points earned by students at schools as well as the standard deviation of the difference between points earned by students at a school and points earned by students in the state across Reporting Categories and Practice Categories. We grouped schools by their EM Perf Stat, an ordinal variable classifying schools by the percentage of students they have that were classified as either Exceeding or Meeting expectations on the MCAS. It appears as though items classified with the Science Practice Category of Mathematics and Data seem to be more challenging to students than those classified as Evidence, Reasoning, and Modeling. These practice categories are strongly and equally emphasized within the exam; items tagged with these categories account for 82% of the available points on the exam with exactly 41% of available points coming from each category.\nWhen considering content Reporting Categories, there do not seem to be discernible distinctions between EM Perf Stat and school’s achievement and performance across categories. All schools appear to perform the strongest on Motion and Forces items, followed by Energy, and weakest on Waves items. Notably, this is also the order of the relative weights of the content areas within the exam; MF, EN, and WA items account for 50%, 30%, and 20% of exam points respectively.\n\n\nCode\n #quantile(HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum$`EMDiff`)\n\n\n \nHSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum%&gt;%\n  group_by(`EM Perf Stat`)%&gt;%\n    summarise( `Mean MD%` = mean(`MD%`), \n              `Mean MD SD` = mean(`MD Diff SD`),\n              `Mean ERM%` = mean(`ERM%`),\n               `Mean ERM SD` = mean(`ERM Diff SD`))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\nHSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum%&gt;%\n  group_by(`EM Perf Stat`)%&gt;%\n    summarise( `Mean MF%` = mean(`MF%`), \n              `Mean MF SD` = mean(`MF Diff SD`),\n              `Mean EN%` = mean(`EN%`),\n               `Mean EN SD` = mean (`EN Diff SD`),\n              `Mean WA%` = mean(`WA%`),\n               `Mean WA SD` = mean (`WA Diff SD`)\n              )"
